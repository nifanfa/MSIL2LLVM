# MSIL2LLVM

![Logo](Logo.svg)

MSIL2LLVM translates a managed assembly built with this repository's CoreLib into a native object file through LLVM. It is not a .NET runtime, NativeAOT frontend, or a general-purpose replacement for the .NET SDK.

## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to support any processor architecture for which LLVM can emit an object file. MSIL2LLVM does not contain x86, ARM, Windows, Linux, or kernel-specific translation logic. The project supplies the LLVM target triple and the native host supplies the ABI-dependent entry point, exception transfer, and linker configuration.

The managed runtime is deliberately small. A user-mode host only needs a small ISO C library surface:

- `malloc`
- `free`
- `memcpy`
- `memset`
- `abort`
- a character output facility for the host's `System_Console_Write_Char` implementation

The following symbols are the runtime boundary implemented by the host. They are not platform APIs and can be implemented for the target processor and environment:

- `setjmp`
- `longjmp`
- `GetCurrentTimeMilliseconds`

The current `setjmp` entry has an additional stack-pointer argument so the generated exception machinery can restore the managed stack state. It therefore requires a target-specific implementation even though `setjmp` and `longjmp` have standard C counterparts. CoreLib implements Console strings, UTF-8 byte spans, numbers, and newlines in managed code; hosts only implement `System_Console_Write_Char(uint16_t)` for one UTF-16 code unit at a time. A host must combine surrogate pairs across calls when it outputs UTF-8.

Projects below the repository root build without the framework class library. `Directory.Build.targets` imports `CoreLib/CoreLib.cs` as a shared source file, so the compiled input assembly contains the runtime types used by the translator.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `MSIL2LLVM/` | The IL-to-LLVM translator. |
| `CoreLib/` | Shared custom CoreLib compiled into managed input assemblies. |
| `ConsoleAppExample/` | Managed test program, including language-feature and GC validation. |
| `apphost/` | Minimal C entry point and host implementations for the console test. |
| `LinuxKernelModuleExample/` | Linux x86-64 kernel-module host, linker inputs, and Kbuild Makefile. |

## Build requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- Local LLVMSharp and Mono.Cecil assemblies under `MSIL2LLVM/lib/`; building MSIL2LLVM does not require their NuGet packages. The LVGL XAML generator still restores Roslyn from NuGet.
- A native linker and host runtime appropriate for the output target
- For `LinuxKernelModuleExample`: GCC, make, and Linux headers matching the kernel that will load the module

Build the translator:

```powershell
dotnet restore MSIL2LLVM\MSIL2LLVM.csproj
dotnet build MSIL2LLVM\MSIL2LLVM.csproj --no-restore
```

## MSIL2LLVM invocation

MSIL2LLVM requires exactly three arguments:

```text
MSIL2LLVM <input-assembly> <output-file> <target>[;<code-model>[;<cpu>[;<features>]]]
```

`target` is an LLVM target triple. The optional code model is one of `default`, `tiny`, `small`, `kernel`, `medium`, or `large`. CPU defaults to `generic`; target features use LLVM's comma-separated `+feature,-feature` syntax.

Examples:

```powershell
MSIL2LLVM\bin\Debug\net10.0\MSIL2LLVM.exe `
  ConsoleAppExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\ConsoleAppExample.dll `
  ConsoleAppExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\ConsoleAppExample.obj `
  x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

MSIL2LLVM\bin\Debug\net10.0\MSIL2LLVM.exe `
  LinuxKernelModuleExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\LinuxKernelModuleExample.dll `
  LinuxKernelModuleExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\LinuxKernelModuleExample.obj `
  "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu;kernel"
```

The second argument is the native output path. MSIL2LLVM removes unreachable
method definitions in memory before translation without writing a trimmed assembly. Entry points,
`[RuntimeExport]` methods, CoreLib runtime hooks, required attribute constructors, and
potential virtual/interface implementations are preserved. This is a conservative
method trim, not type or field removal. Mark methods called only by native code
with `[RuntimeExport]`. Dynamically chosen reflection targets and generic
instantiations cannot always be discovered from IL; make them statically reachable
if they must be preserved. The removed-method count describes IL definitions, not
the number of native functions emitted; runtime-generated helpers and metadata
also contribute to the output. LLVM emits a
relocatable object (or assembly for `.S` output); archive creation and final native linking
are separate build steps. The output uses static relocation. Globals created by
the translator for managed static fields, GC descriptors, field data, and
compiler-generated helpers use internal linkage. Managed entry points and
`[DllImport("*")]` imports remain external symbols for the host linker.

The Windows build uses the repository's `MSIL2LLVM/lib/win-x64/libLLVM.dll`.
It is built from [nifanfa/llvm-project](https://github.com/nifanfa/llvm-project),
based on LLVM 21.1.8 with the experimental Xtensa backend enabled in addition
to the regular LLVM targets. Build details and licensing are in
`MSIL2LLVM/lib/win-x64/README.md`.

### Calling convention

MSIL2LLVM emits all generated calls using the C `cdecl` calling convention. This applies to calls across the managed/native boundary as well as calls to host runtime symbols. The host runtime must therefore expose matching `cdecl` entry points; MSIL2LLVM does not automatically select or adapt platform-specific calling conventions.

The Visual Studio launch profiles in `MSIL2LLVM/Properties/launchSettings.json` provide the same commands for the console x86/x64 objects and the Linux x86-64 kernel object.

## Custom runtime boundary

`CoreLib` is source compiled into each managed program. It provides the managed definitions used by generated code, including object layout, arrays, strings, exceptions, collections, delegates, tasks, and GC metadata.
`System.Text.Encoding.UTF8` supports encoding managed strings and decoding UTF-8 byte arrays or `ReadOnlySpan<byte>` values (including `u8` literals), replacing invalid sequences with U+FFFD. `GetBytes` returns only encoded bytes; append a zero byte explicitly when passing a C-style string to native code.

Platform-specific operations remain external. Methods marked with `[DllImport("*")]` are native symbols. The final host must provide every imported symbol that the managed program reaches. Examples include allocation, deallocation, block memory operations, non-local exception transfer, abort, console output, and wall-clock time. GC and exception frame tracking are implemented in `CoreLib`.

### Reuse native libraries

Prefer C# for application logic and interop with existing C/C++ libraries for hardware drivers, graphics, networking, and other platform-specific facilities. MSIL2LLVM is not intended to replace the C/C++ ecosystem: rewriting mature drivers in C# usually adds maintenance work without improving the application. The ESP32-S3 LVGL example follows this approach by using native LVGL and Arduino display/touch libraries while keeping the UI logic in C#.

Import a library's C ABI with `[DllImport("*")]`; for a C++-only API, expose a small `extern "C"` wrapper rather than depending on a compiler-specific C++ ABI. Link the generated object with the native libraries and provide only the bindings your application needs. Keep the native argument and callback rules below in mind when defining that boundary.

### Native arguments and callbacks

Unlike CLR P/Invoke, MSIL2LLVM does not marshal managed `string` or array arguments into native character or element pointers. A `[DllImport("*")]` signature must describe the actual native ABI; passing a `string` or `T[]` directly passes a managed object reference, not its contents. Use the `ByReference<T>` implicit conversions in `CoreLib` to pass a pointer to the first element instead: `string` converts to `ByReference<char>` (UTF-16 characters), and `T[]` converts to `ByReference<T>`. For example, the `Console.WriteLine(ByReference<char>)` import accepts a string through that conversion. Match the native character width, provide a length when needed, and note that empty strings or arrays convert to a null reference. Arrays currently reserve one zero-filled element beyond their logical length, but pass an explicit length or construct a properly terminated native buffer rather than relying on that implementation detail. Keep the underlying managed data alive for the duration of the native call.

Do not pass a managed `Delegate` object or its raw function pointer directly as an unmanaged callback. Delegate invocation supplies the bound target (`this`) as a leading argument, but a native caller does not supply that argument automatically; even static-method delegate thunks use this internal calling shape. The resulting signature mismatch is unsafe. Use a callback with a matching unmanaged function-pointer signature (such as a suitable static `delegate* unmanaged<...>` entry point), or write an explicit native/managed trampoline that passes the target context and manages its lifetime. Native callbacks must also respect the single-native-thread restriction described below.

The built-in collector uses GC descriptors emitted by MSIL2LLVM and registers static fields as roots. It is not a replacement for the host allocator: `Marshal.AllocHGlobal` and `FreeHGlobal` import `malloc` and `free`, while new managed allocations are cleared through `Unsafe.InitBlock`. Block copies use `Unsafe.CopyBlock`; these methods import `memset` and `memcpy` respectively.

`System.Threading.Monitor.Enter` and `Exit` remain available so C# `lock` statements compile. On the single managed execution thread they only validate their arguments and maintain the `lockTaken` flag; they do not provide mutual exclusion or track lock ownership. Do not use them to synchronize native threads.

### Async tasks on one native thread

`System.Threading.Thread` and automatic yields at loop back edges are not supported. Ordinary synchronous code runs to completion; a long-running or infinite loop blocks other managed work. Use `async`/`await` and `TaskCompletionSource` to suspend at explicit asynchronous operations instead of copying the call stack.

Task continuations run when the awaited task completes on the same managed thread. There is no native thread pool or implicit scheduler. `Task.Wait()` and `Task<T>.Result` remain synchronous; without a platform-specific `WaitForCompletion` implementation, calling them on a pending task blocks indefinitely. Prefer `await` for pending tasks.

A native timer, signal handler, interrupt handler, or worker thread must not call into managed code concurrently or inject a managed callback at an arbitrary instruction. Native event sources must queue work for the single native execution thread, which can then complete a task during its event loop.

### Minimal `TaskCompletionSource<T>` example

Use `TaskCompletionSource<T>` when a C event source will produce a value later.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Runtime;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

internal static class Program
{
    static TaskCompletionSource<int> pending;

    static Task<int> ReadAsync()
    {
        pending = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();
        return pending.Task;
    }

    static async Task RunAsync()
    {
        int value = await ReadAsync();
        Console.WriteLine(value);
    }

    [RuntimeExport("OnValue")]
    static void OnValue(int value)
    {
        TaskCompletionSource<int> current = pending;
        pending = null;
        current?.SetResult(value);
    }

    // This is the managed entry point called by native code.
    static void Main()
    {
        _ = RunAsync();
    }
}
```

The native side can call the exported method when its event is ready:

```c
// These symbols are generated/provided by the managed object.
extern void managed_Main(void);
extern void OnValue(int value);

static void process_event(void)
{
    OnValue(42);
}

int main(void)
{
    managed_Main();  // RunAsync reaches await and returns here.
    process_event(); // Completes the TaskCompletionSource.
    return 0;
}
```

The program prints `42`. `managed_Main()` starts `RunAsync()` and returns when it reaches `await`; `OnValue(42)` then calls `SetResult`, which resumes the `await`. In a real host, `process_event` would be an event-loop step. The callback must run on the same managed/event-loop thread; an interrupt or native worker must queue the event instead of calling managed code directly. A source should be completed only once.

The minimal `Monitor` implementation is only for single-threaded `lock` compatibility. It does not prevent callbacks or native threads from accessing the same object, and it does not check that `Exit` matches a preceding `Enter`.

## Console host

Build the managed console input first:

```powershell
dotnet build ConsoleAppExample\ConsoleAppExample.csproj
```

Generate an object with one of the console launch profiles or with the command above. Link that object with `apphost/apphost.c`, `apphost/Runtime.c`, and a native toolchain for the selected target. `apphost` calls `managed_Main` directly; it does not start `dotnet` or load a CLR.

For a Linux x86-64 user-mode executable, select `Build ConsoleAppExample(Linux x86_64)` or generate the object with `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, then run:

```sh
cd apphost
make
./ConsoleAppExample
```

The Makefile links the existing object with `Runtime.c`. It does not build the managed project or run MSIL2LLVM.

## Linux kernel module

`LinuxKernelModuleExample` is an x86-64 example. It calls `managed_Main` from the module init function and supplies the runtime boundary in `Runtime.c` and `runtime_jump_x86_64.S`.

Generate the managed object using the `kernel` code model:

```powershell
dotnet build LinuxKernelModuleExample\LinuxKernelModuleExample.csproj
dotnet MSIL2LLVM\bin\Debug\net10.0\MSIL2LLVM.dll `
  LinuxKernelModuleExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\LinuxKernelModuleExample.dll `
  LinuxKernelModuleExample\bin\Debug\net10.0\LinuxKernelModuleExample.obj `
  "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu;kernel"
```

Then, in the Linux environment that has headers for the target kernel:

```sh
cd LinuxKernelModuleExample
make KDIRS=/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build
sudo insmod my_module.ko
dmesg | tail -n 30
sudo rmmod my_module
```

The `kernel` code model is required because modules are loaded in the high kernel address range. It emits signed 32-bit and other kernel-supported relocations instead of `R_X86_64_32` or GOT-relative relocations that the Linux 5.4 module loader rejects.

This example is not portable to another architecture without a matching native host, exception-transfer implementation, target triple, and code-model choice. It also must be built against headers compatible with the kernel that loads it.

## ESP32-S3

`ESP32S3Example` contains an Arduino sketch and its native runtime boundary.
The `Build ESP32S3Example(Xtensa)` launch profile emits
`ESP32S3Example/ESP32S3Example.S`. Arduino can compile the assembly source when
it is placed beside the sketch, without additional assembler flags.
Other output paths continue to produce one relocatable object; MSIL2LLVM does not
create archives.

The bundled LLVM writes aligned constant-pool labels and `.long` values directly
before each Xtensa function. Generated assembly does not depend on
`--text-section-literals`, so no configuration script or `platform.local.txt`
change is required.

The launch profile enables LLVM's `+windowed` Xtensa feature so generated code
uses the same windowed ABI as the ESP32 Arduino toolchain.

`ESP32S3LVGLExample` uses the touch display for three LVGL screens: brightness
controls, device information, and a scrollable gallery containing every supported
XAML control. Tap **About**, **Widgets**, or **Brightness** at the bottom to cycle
between them; the brightness setting remains unchanged when switching.
Regenerate `ESP32S3LVGLExample/ESP32S3LVGLExample.S` with the
`Build ESP32S3LVGLExample(Xtensa)` launch profile before building the Arduino sketch.

The layouts live in `ESP32S3LVGLExample/BrightnessPage.xaml`,
`ESP32S3LVGLExample/AboutPage.xaml`, and `ESP32S3LVGLExample/WidgetsPage.xaml`.
The example includes `*.xaml` as
`AdditionalFiles` for `LVGLXAMLGenerator`, a Roslyn incremental source
generator. The compiler generates and compiles a `.xaml.g.cs` for each page;
new pages need no per-page project edits. Generated sources appear under the
analyzer's generated files in Visual Studio, rather than beside the XAML.
This is a small LVGL-specific XAML subset, not WPF XAML: `<Screen>` declares
`Class` and `Method` and contains `Object`, `Label`, `Button`, `Checkbox`,
`Switch`, `Bar`, `Slider`, `Arc`, `Dropdown`, `Roller`, `TextArea`, or `Table`.
`Table` also supports `Column` and `Cell` child elements. Nesting sets the LVGL parent;
`Style` children apply part-specific arc, background, shadow, and text font settings.
`Part` defaults to `Main` and also accepts `Indicator` or `Knob`; colors use
`#RRGGBB`, and opacities use either `0`-`255` or `0%`-`100%`. The gallery's
arc demonstrates these styles with the LVGL theme's large font.
LVGL 8.4 has no subject binding for the arc and label, so callbacks update the
label and bar when their controls change.
`Name` gives a widget a name for `RelativeTo`/`EventData`, and
`Field="true"` exposes it as a static field in the partial class.
Sizes, alignment, padding, text, ranges, values, flags, and callbacks use
the attributes shown in the example pages. The generated method takes
`(LVObject screen, LVObject navigationTarget)`; `On` names an existing
`[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` static callback, `Filter` names a supported LVGL event,
and `EventData` passes a named widget's handle or `navigationTarget.Handle`.
Unsupported controls or attributes fail generation instead of being ignored.
The pages specify the local `LVGLXAMLGenerator/LVGLPage.xsd` directly with
`xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation`; no LVGL XML namespace or IDE-specific schema
selection is needed. The `xmlns:xsi` value is an XML identifier, not a network
request. Open `.xaml` with Visual Studio's XML editor rather than its WPF
designer for XSD completions.

## Scope and limitations

- MSIL2LLVM translates methods with bodies in the input assembly. It does not link arbitrary .NET framework assemblies.
- Unsupported IL or unresolved managed methods stop translation with an error; they are not silently replaced by runtime stubs.
- Managed code runs on one native execution thread. Concurrent or asynchronously injected managed execution remains unsupported, including callbacks entered from native timer or worker threads.
- There is no automatic executable or module linker step in the MSBuild targets. Object generation and native linking are separate steps.
- Linux kernel code must not rely on the C standard library. The kernel example provides its own implementations for the external symbols it uses.
- Native runtime code is target-specific by design; CoreLib and MSIL2LLVM do not select runtime layouts or exception buffers from the target triple.
